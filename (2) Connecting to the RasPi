There are several methods of connecting to the RasPi. Most simply, Pi does have an HDMI port and four USB ports, so if you would like, you can edit code directly on the Pi by plugging in your monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

Alternatively, I found it much simpler to remotely connect to the RasPi. The easiest way to do this is to use PuTTY (download at putty.org). As long as you are on the same WiFi or Ethernet network as the Pi, you can type in its IP address and then use the Pi's login info to access the terminal which is all you need for most things. If you are using the Baja RasPi, I can give you this login information. Alternatively the default user and password are pi and raspberry (I believe).

Please note that as you type in the password PuTTY will not actually type any characters. This is not an error, its just PuTTY's method for censoring the password.

Alternatively, if you need to use the full graphical desktop you can use VNC Viewer (download here:  www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/ ). Once you download, you can  type in the IP address to the Pi in that top search bar, then it should prompt you to enter the login information.
